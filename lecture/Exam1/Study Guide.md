# Study Guide for Exam 1

This is a study guide to help you focus on the concepts that will be tested.  This is only a guide.  You are responsible for **all** material covered in class, in labs, and through assignments during this testing period.

The exam covers the **"Programming Review"**, **"Lists, Stacks and Queues"**, **"Algorithm Analysis"**, and **"Sorting"** sections.

Review labs 1 through 4.

The exam will consist of matching questions, short answer questions and code implementation questions (either fill in the blank or placing blocks of code in the correct order).

1. Be able to briefly define, describe, or use the following programming concepts:
```
        recursion                           classes
        public vs. private members          friend functions
        implementation vs. header file      pass-by-value vs. pass-by-reference
        const modifier                      initializer list
        default constructor                 parameterized constructor
        copy constructor                    shallow copy vs. deep copy
        destructor                          dynamic allocation (new/delete) 
        "rule of three"/"big 5"             operator functions
        inheritance
```
2. Be able to describe, implement, or use the following data structures:
```
        arrays
        vectors
        linked lists (singly / doubly / circular)
        stacks
        queues
```
3. Be able to describe the asymptotic order of mathematical functions using big-O, big-Ω and Θ notation
4. Be able to determine the run-time order of a fragment of code or function containing nested and/or sequential loops with or without recursion
5. Understand best-case vs. worst-case vs. average-case (typical single case) vs. amortized (on a sequence of operations including average and worst-case) analysis
6. Understand how the following algorithms operate (in general) and their properties (time/space complexity, best/worst/average case, stable vs. unstable sort, etc.)
```
        linear/sequential search
        binary search
        selection sort
        insertion sort
        bubble sort
        shell sort
        merge sort
        quicksort
        heapsort
        bucket sort
        counting sort
        radix sort
```
7. Understand the properties of sorting algorithms:
```
        best/worst/average case
        stable vs. unstable
        in-place vs. out-of-place
        adaptive (best-case < average-case)
        iterative vs. recursive
        stepwise refinement / incremental construction / divide and conquer
        deterministic vs. randomized
        comparison (only compares key vs. key in data) vs. non-comparison sorting
        simplicity of implementation / analysis
```
8. Be able to implement the divide-and-conquer algorithms discussed: binary search, merge sort, and quicksort.
